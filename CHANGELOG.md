### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* Configuration file renamed from .envrc to meshcore.conf. Users must copy meshcore.conf.example to meshcore.conf and migrate their settings. The new file format is the same (shell-style exports) but without the direnv-specific "layout python3" command.

### Features

* auto-load config from meshcore.conf ([8ca5a1e](https://github.com/jorijn/meshcore-stats/commit/8ca5a1e6d0f29fce1c66f526116c6cd484c0f8b5))
