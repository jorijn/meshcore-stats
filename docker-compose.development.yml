# MeshCore Stats - Development Override
#
# Use this file for local development with live code changes.
#
# Usage:
#   docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.development.yml up --build
#
# This override:
# - Builds the image locally instead of pulling from ghcr.io
# - Mounts src/ and scripts/ for live code changes (no rebuild needed)

services:
  meshcore-stats:
    # Build locally instead of using published image
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile

    # Remove the image reference (use built image)
    image: meshcore-stats:development

    # Mount source code for live development
    # Changes to Python files take effect immediately (no rebuild needed)
    volumes:
      - ./data/state:/data/state
      - output_data:/out
      # Development mounts (read-only to prevent accidental writes)
      - ./src:/app/src:ro
      - ./scripts:/app/scripts:ro
