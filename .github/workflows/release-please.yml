# Note: We use a fine-grained PAT (RELEASE_PLEASE_TOKEN) instead of GITHUB_TOKEN
# because GITHUB_TOKEN cannot trigger other workflows (like docker-publish.yml).
# This is a GitHub security feature to prevent infinite workflow loops.
#
# The PAT requires these permissions (scoped to this repository only):
# - Contents: Read and write (for creating releases and pushing tags)
# - Pull requests: Read and write (for creating/updating release PRs)
#
# To rotate: Settings > Developer settings > Fine-grained tokens
# Recommended rotation: Every 90 days
